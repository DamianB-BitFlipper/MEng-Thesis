Transaction authentication is an attractive extension to two-factor authentication. It is proposed in the WebAuthn standard by the World-Wide-Web Consortium (W3C) as a mechanism to secure individual ``high-risk'' operations of a website via a hardware authenticator device. It defends against a stringent threat model where an adversary can modify or create HTTP requests between the user and the web service. 

Transaction authentication as defined by WebAuthn is not yet adopted in practice, partially because it requires intrusive web application changes.

This thesis presents \sys{}, a firewall for integrating transaction authentication into a new or existing web service with relatively few code changes. The firewall intercepts all HTTP traffic sent to the web service, and based on the configuration, any requests deemed safe are proxied directly to the web service. All other requests are considered high-risk and are held back and validated using transaction authentication. Only if the validation passes are they also permitted to pass through to the web service.

%% The aim is to lower the barriers preventing its adoption. An engineer would need to populate a configuration file for the firewall and make relatively few code changes to the web service to integrate transaction authentication.

This thesis uses the firewall approach to integrate transaction authentication into three web applications. Compared to directly modifying them to support transaction authentication, the firewall approach is close to 8 times more concise. Under heavy load, there is an associated latency of at worst 1.5x slower when using \sys{} versus accessing the original web service directly without WebAuthn.

%% evaluates the footprint and complexity of the firewall approach. It is close to 8 times more concise than the typical means for integrating transaction authentication in a web service. This entails easier development and fewer opportunities for accidental bugs or errors in the code. However, under heavy load, there is an associated latency of at worst 1.5x slower when using \sys{} when compared to accessing the original web service directly without WebAuthn.
